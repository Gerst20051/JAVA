/*
Write an interface called NumberHolder
The interface should have two methods that need to be implemented by any 

Class that implements the interface
- public void setNumber(int newNumber)
- public int getNumber()

Write a class called MathClass that implements the three interfaces 

NumberHolder, Factorial, and Sum
- This class should have an int field called n. That is, the type of the number property is int
- The setNumber method should set a new value to n
- The getNumber method should return the value of n
- This class should implement all of the methods of the NumberHolder, Factorial, and Sum interfaces
- The getFactorial method returns the factorial of the int number
- The getSum method returns the sum of all numbers from 1 up to n
